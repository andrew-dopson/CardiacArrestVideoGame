# CardiacArrestVideoGame
Senior thesis video game project

This video game was designed to be a Horror themed game where the player wears a heart rate monitor. The heart rate monitor sends heart rate data to the game and it adjusts the heartbeat animation in the top right of the HUD accordingly. If the player's heart rate exceeds a certain limit, the player loses the game. Originally, the game was intended to be used with a bluetooth watch (Mio Alpha). Unfortunately we ran into troubles trying to receive the heart rate data from the watch through a bluetooth connection to the player's computer, but the game still shows a proof of concept on what could be done with it going forward.
